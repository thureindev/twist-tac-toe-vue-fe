## About Dev

Hi, I'm ThuRein, you can call me Tom. I'm passionate about creating apps and solving frontend logic, but I often find myself bogged down by design decisions. That's why I created this templateâ€”to minimize the time spent worrying about design so I can focus on what I love: building functional, efficient web applications. I hope this template helps you do the same!

## About This Template

This template serves as a design boilerplate for quickly bringing new ideas to life. It comes pre-configured with Vite, Vue, and Tailwind CSS, allowing you to focus on frontend logic rather than design. I used Tailwind for its rapid prototyping capabilities. Although, Tailwind can make HTML code messy, it works well with Vue's Single File Components if you know how to keep it clean.

GitHub workflow setup is already included in this template, providing instant deployment right out of the box. You only need to [change base url in vite config file](./README.md#deploying-on-github-pages). Whether you're starting a new project or iterating on an existing one, this template is designed to help you move fast and efficiently.
